# Mosh Hamedani C# Intermediate Course solved exercises and experiments

This repo contains the code I made when learning from Mosh Hamedani's course "C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP". It includes my answers to all proposed exercises and some extra experimentation classes.

The answers to each exercise are contained in single cs files, for my convenience at the time, and are named after the section in which the exercise was proposed.
